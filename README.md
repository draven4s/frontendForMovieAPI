#The frontend for the API.
Frontend written mainly using React. Used a .net template for React so the testing could be easier. Bootstrap used to make it a tiny bit prettier.

##What it can do already:
  1. Get's the data from the movieAPI and displays it on the website.
  2. Sorting is currently only by name or release year. More comming soon.
  3. The ability to view a movies info by IMDBID.
  
##What needs to be done:
  1. Adding more relative data about the movies.
  2. Cleaning up the code and restructuring it.
  3. More sorting options.
  4. Some sort of a filtering option.
  5. Ability to view all of the movies in the database.
  6. The design needs a facelift.
